# InfiniteRunnerGame
An infinite runner game I am building in Unity to help better my understanding of the IDE and C in general. I used a YouTube tutorial for part of it

Due to limited experience in Blender, and more specifically the animation workflow in Blender, I've decided to deviate from the original model to a more simple car model. Hoping to push these changes soon

There is no executable file for this project yet, I want to reorganize the repo to clear pointless Unity binaries before I countinue work on this project
